# BackTracking Algorithm 

 Backtracking is an algorithm that inspects the number of all combinations, but only when they meet the conditions. It is usually used to solve the condition satisfaction problem. (Called CSP)
 
 It is similar to the Brutforce algorithm in that it looks at the number of all cases. However, there is a difference in that if the conditions are not met, they are not tested, and these features are useful in certain situations.

In order to solve this algorithm, I think that understanding the graph data structure and having the ability to implement DFS and BFS should precede. 

+ DFS -> Depth-First Search
+ BFS -> Breadth-First Search
