# Greedy Algorithm

[BOJ_Greedy](https://www.acmicpc.net/step/33)

It is an algorithm that chooses the best result for each situation, assuming that the best choice in the current state produces the best result. Since it is an algorithm that eats up marshmallows right in front of you, a series of best choices cannot always come up with the best answer.
