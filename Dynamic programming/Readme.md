# Dynamic programming

In dynamic programming, "programming" does not mean "computer programming," but rather means creating tables.

In many cases, division conquest is used to create algorithms, and when it is difficult to solve a big problem at once, it is divided into small problems are solved. When solving small problems, there are times when overlapping calculations are made, and because calculating them again every time takes too much time, dynamic programming is a technique that stores the values and uses them again later.

Memoization is typically used in DP, a method of storing and using the values in a specific place to reduce the number of calculations repeatedly calculated during recursive calls.
